Clocktwerk
===========

A collection of small Twitter related applications, including 
a Twitterbot that automates the posting of updates at 
regular intervals, and a reply bot that automatically
responds to mentions. All relevant apps authenticate 
via OAuth (see https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth/faq), 
hence do not need access to Twitter login credentials. 

Sample accounts (mostly) driven by Clocktwerk:

* <a href="https://twitter.com/Wise8Ball" target="_blank">Randomised reply bot</a>

Building
===========

Clocktwerk uses Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
To compile and build a distro in zip format:

    mvn clean assembly:assembly 

To run unit tests and generate a test coverage report:

    mvn clean cobertura:cobertura

Authentication to Twitter
===========================

Clocktwerk uses the Twitter 1.1 API to read and write 
updates. To authorise this access for the account you
want to automate, you will need to create a Twitter
application on the Twitter developer site. Login to
Twitter as the user that Clocktwerk will be tweeting
on behalf of, then follow the instructions at 
https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new. You will need to
select "Read and Write" as the application type, but
if you neglect to do so, you can edit the settings for
your app later. A good idea is to name the app after the
account you are automating, e.g. "Username Bot", where
Username is the target twitter account. 

Once you have created your application, Twitter will 
have allocated a 'Consumer key' and 'Consumer secret' 
that identifies your app. You will need these values
in order to allow Clocktwerk to authenticate to 
Twitter.

The relavant OAuth credentials are read from a
`twitter4j.properties` file, which can usually be either
placed on the Java classpath, or passed as a command line
parameter at runtime. Clocktwerk includes a tool to 
generate this file for you. Once you have built a distro 
and unpacked it to your runtime location, you can use the 
`oauth.sh` script to generate this file and drop it onto 
the classpath; just follow the instructions from the script:

    ./oauth.sh [Consumer key] [Consumer secret]

The script will build a `twitter4j.properties` file that
includes the authentication details granted by your 
Twitter user to your new application. The oauth script
moves this file into the lib directory, thus placing it
on the Java classpath. You could put the file anywhere
else you prefer, as long as you add the directory
to the classpath when you launch the Clocktwerk
application.


Clocktwerk - automated tweets
===========================

Feeding Clocktwerk your tweets
---------------------------------------

Tweets are pulled from a `tweets.txt` file on the JVM classpath.
Once you have prepared your tweets file, dropping it into the
lib directory is an easy way to place it on the classpath.
However, as with the `twitter4j.properties` file, you can put
his file anywhere you like so long as you modify the JVM
classpath accordingly.

Each line in the file constitutes a single tweet; tweets 
longer than 140 characters are ignored. No further 
validation is performed against the content of each 
tweet. When the last tweet from the file has been posted, 
Clocktwerk starts again from the first line, thus it
will never run out of tweets.

Clocktwerk persists the index into `tweets.txt`. Hence, when 
you start the application, tweeting continues from the 
location previously reached, rather than starting again 
from the beginning of the file.

Tweet Scheduling
---------------------------------------

There are two ways to schedule your tweets: internally 
to Clocktwerk, or externally using some additional tool.
External scheduling usually offers a lot more flexibility;
Clocktwerk's internal scheduling is fairly crude and 
limited.

<dl>
  <dt>Internal Scheduling</dt>
</dl>
You can run Clocktwerk as a daemon process, whereby it will
run in the background, doing nothing until it is time to
send the next scheduled tweet. By default, Clocktwerk tweets 
every 6 hours, sending the first tweet when the application 
starts up. You can override this default using a Java system 
property to specify the interval between tweets in milliseconds. 
For example, to tweet once every 24 hours, you would edit 
`tweet-daemon.sh` thus (86400000 being 24 hours expressed
as milliseconds)

    nohup java -classpath lib:lib/* -Dtweetdaemon.tweetinterval.milliseconds=86400000 com.michaelfitzmaurice.clocktwerk.apps.Clocktwerk &

<dl>
  <dt>External Scheduling (preferred)</dt>
</dl>
External tools such as cron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
offer much more scheduling flexibility than Clocktwerk's
approach of simply doing something every n minutes
or hours. To support use of tools like cron, Clocktwerk
offers a "single tweet" mode. In single tweet mode, 
Clocktwerk sends the next tweet and then exits, as opposed
to running continuously as a daemon.

The `single-tweet.sh` script launches Clocktwerk in this mode.
You can schedule this script to run on whatever timetable you
like, for example to tweet at 12:30, 16:00 and 22:00,
your crontab would look something like:

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    30 12 * * * /opt/clocktwerk-1.2/single-tweet.sh
    0 16,22 * * * /opt/clocktwerk-1.2/single-tweet.sh
